# chgChess
This is version 1 with GUI with all main features and computer play based in alfabeta (basic) out of the box with 5 depth <br>
version 2 will improve alfabeta to order potential movements in the search in each level to optimize prunning <br>
In build time, the pieces/chess.png file is not included in executable jar file <br>
From Netbeans it runs properly though <br>
So in order to run the jar file we have to previously run: <br>
jar -uf target.jar <pathtopieces> <br>
to update the jar file <br>
or even just copy <piecesfolder> to jar file home <br>
