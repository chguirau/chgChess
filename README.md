# chgChess
This is version 1 with GUI with all main features and computer play based in alfabeta (basic) out of the box with 5 depth
In build time, the pieces/chess.png file is not included in executable jar file
From Netbeans it runs properly
So in order to run the jar file we have to run:
jar -uf target.jar <pathtopieces>
or even just copy <piecesfolder> to jar home
